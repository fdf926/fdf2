            Finally, I stepped onto the land of Shennongjia, a place I’d always dreamed of exploring. This 5A-level scenic area, crowned as a World Geopark and National Forest Park, feels like a living ecological museum at every turn.
 
The highlight was Shennong Peak. As I drove, the 3,000-meter summit loomed through the clouds, almost within reach. In Jinhou Ridge’s primeval forest, towering firs blocked out the sun, and the mossy ground was as soft as velvet. Squirrels darted around, adding life to the ancient woods. Banbi Rock, with its jagged stone formations, sparked my imagination—legend says it’s a haunt of “wild men,” and I half-expected to stumble upon mysterious footprints.
 
Dajiuhu was pure magimirrors veiled in mist, reflecting the emerald peaks. Riding a small train through the area, lulled by the trickling streams, I could almost picture fairies bathing here. Learning that it was once a military base in ancient rebellions added a thrilling layer to its natural beauty.
 onkeys for the first tis, eagerly reaching out for food. One bold male even posed for photos, stealing the show! The park’s panda hall and rare plants were a bonus, like a hands-on science lesson.
 
This trip taught .” Wild herbs with e Flower” dotted the paths, each carrying an otherworldly charm. At night, savoring local dishes like cured pork trotters and mushroom stew, I could taste the mountain’s essence in every bite.
 
As I waved goodbye to Shennongjia’s misty peaks, I knew I’d be back—next time, to explore Tianyan’s hidden caves or carve through snowy slopes in winter.

          <h2 class="card-title">景点名称  布鲁威斯号</h2>

          <p class="card-desc">
            I visited Weihai this time and saw the famous Bruwis, which was really shocking
 
The Bruwis is a Panama-registered empty bulk carrier, 190 meters long and 31 meters wide, with a loading capacity of up to 60,000 tons. In September 2022, affected by the outer circulation of Typhoon "Nanmadol", it ran aground in the waters of Haoyunjiao Tourist Resort, Rongcheng City, Weihai.
 
Originally destined for retirement, dismantling, or resale, it unexpectedly became popular due to the grounding. Since spring 2023, with the help of social media, it has attracted large numbers of  tourists specifically to "punch in." During the 2024 Spring Festival holiday, it received an average of over 12,000 visitors daily, with peaks exceeding 30,000.
 
The ship is perfect for photos. Its rusty hull exudes industrial beauty, suitable for any photography style. At sunrise, golden light spills over the ship; at sunset, the evening glow makes the scene breathtaking. Moreover, the romantic seaside atmosphere here is palpable—sea breeze whispers, waves lap against the ship and beach, and strolling around makes time seem to slow down.
 
Surrounding facilities are constantly improving, with a sand sculpture art park, ship restaurant, and planned projects like internet-famous homestays and cafes. When visiting, you can watch the sunrise in the morning, enjoy seafood nearby at noon, explore surrounding attractions in the afternoon, and return to admire the sunset in the evening.
 
The Bruwis is truly worth a visit. Its unique beauty and story are unforgettable.
